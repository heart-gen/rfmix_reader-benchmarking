# `RFMix-reader`: Accelerated reading and processing for local ancestry studies

This repository contains the code for the `RFMix-reader` manuscript that describes the [RFMix-reader](https://github.com/heart-gen/rfmix_reader) software.

## Abstract
**Motivation:** Local ancestry inference is a powerful technique in genetics, revealing population history and the genetic basis of diseases. It is particularly valuable 
for improving eQTL discovery and fine-mapping in admixed populations. Despite the widespread use of the [`RFMix`](https://github.com/slowkoni/rfmix) software for local 
ancestry inference, large-scale genomic studies face challenges with high memory consumption and processing times when handling `RFMix` output files.<br /> **Results:** 
Here, I present `RFMix-reader`, a new Python-based parsing software, designed to streamline the analysis of large-scale local ancestry datasets. This software prioritizes 
computational efficiency and memory optimization, leveraging GPUs when available for additional speed boosts. By overcoming these data processing hurdles, `RFMix-reader` 
empowers researchers to unlock the full potential of local ancestry data for understanding human health and health disparities.<br /> **Availability:** `RFMix-reader` is 
freely available on PyPI at [https://pypi.org/project/rfmix-reader/](https://pypi.org/project/rfmix-reader/), implemented in Python 3, and supported on Linux, Windows, and 
Mac OS.<br /> **Contact:** [KynonJade.Benjamin@libd.org](KynonJade.Benjamin@libd.org)<br /> **Supplementary information:** Supplementary data are available at 
[https://rfmix-reader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://rfmix-reader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
